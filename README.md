# MECH501_asgn2

Final Project for MECH 501, Fall 2023 Term, McGill University.

All code is written by David Brenken

FILE DECOMPRESSION:

two directories are too large to directly host in github.

These are: ./Models and ./CNN_data/audio

The contents for ./Models is mandatory for compiling the markdown in the main .ipynb file.

The contents of ./CNN_data/audio are the .wav files from the original dataset

the dropbox link for both is provided here:
