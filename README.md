# MECH501_asgn2

Final Project for MECH 501, Fall 2023 Term, McGill University.

All code is written by David Brenken


Instructions to run code:

Step 1. Create a python .venv of version 3.10.9 in this directory
Step 2. Install dependencies with pip, ensuring the version is correct:



FILE DECOMPRESSION:

two directories are too large to directly host in github.

These are: ./Models and ./CNN_data/audio

The contents for ./Models is mandatory for compiling the markdown in the main .ipynb file.

The contents of ./CNN_data/audio are the .wav files from the original dataset. This is mandatory to generate the dataset

the dropbox link for both is provided here:

./CNN_data/audio:

Note that you must create the respective directories (i.e. ./Models and ./CNN_data/audio) when you unzip the files! If these paths are incorrect with respect to your python interpreter, the code will not run.
